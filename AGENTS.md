# Vibe — agent guide (Grok)

Grok loads this file automatically as project rules (see xAI docs: Project Rules /
`AGENTS.md`). Supported top-level names: `Agents.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`,
`Claude.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`. **`GROK.md` is not a recognized
filename** — use this file (or `.grok/rules/*.md`) for Grok-native rules.

Also loaded when present: `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code compat). Deeper paths win on
conflicts. Inspect with: `grok inspect`.

## "Run it on my mobile" / "launch it on my device"

The user means: **build + install + launch the iOS app on their attached iPhone.**

- Target device: **"iPhone" — iPhone 16 Pro Max**, UDID `00008140-000935000288801C`
- Bundle id: `com.vibegram.app` · Project `ios/Vibe.xcodeproj` · Scheme `Vibe`
- **Building is free** — just build it (no need to ask).
- **Installing the build onto the phone is free** (`xcrun devicectl device install app`
  — just copies the binary over, no observable effect until it's run).
- **Launching it asks first** (`xcrun devicectl device process launch`) — confirm
  before the app actually runs on the real device.

Exact commands + device table: [docs/run-on-device.md](docs/run-on-device.md).

## Deploying server changes (production git remote)

**Required after server-side edits** under `server/` (Elixir controllers, `chat.ex`,
channels, migrations, etc.): commit on `main`, then push to the **mako** remote so
the production server can pull/deploy from that repo.

```bash
# After commit on main:
git push mako main
```

- Remote: `mako` → `https://github.com/mako-apps/Vibe.git`
- Branch: **`main`** (do not invent another deploy branch unless the user says so)
- Also push `origin` only if the user asks; production deploy path for this workspace
  is **`git push mako main`**
- Migrations and runtime config land with whatever deploy pull/hook the mako host uses
  after that push — agents should **not** SSH/deploy by hand unless explicitly asked

If the push needs auth or is rejected, stop and report the error; do not force-push
(`--force` / `--force-with-lease`) without explicit user approval.

## After any iOS code change — build and fix

**Required:** whenever you patch, add, or refactor files under `ios/`, run an
`xcodebuild` for scheme `Vibe` and **fix compile errors before considering the
task done**. Do not leave a broken build for the user.

```bash
xcodebuild -project ios/Vibe.xcodeproj -scheme Vibe \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS,id=00008140-000935000288801C' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/vibe-device-build \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  build
```

If the physical phone is offline, use a simulator destination instead
(`platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16`). On failure: read the error, fix the
Swift, rebuild, and repeat until green. Building is free (no approval needed).

## Tool approval config

Interactive approvals for agents in this repo are governed by
`~/.vibe/agent-config.toml` → `approval_mode`:

- `local` (default) — approve/answer everything on this device; nothing goes to the phone.
- `mobile` — route non-auto-allowed tools to the phone (falls back local if unanswered).
- `auto` — safe/allow-listed commands run without asking; only blockers go to the phone.
- `full` — allow everything except the always-blocked destructive commands.

Destructive commands (rm -rf, sudo, git push, git reset --hard, dd, mkfs, curl|sh,
npm publish, ...) are blocked in every remote mode, even `full`.

## Ask Fable (advisor) on complex tasks

**Required:** on complex tasks, ask **Fable** **before** you commit to an approach
or start a large implementation. Fable is a second-opinion advisor only — it does
not edit code; you still implement and verify.

### When to ask

Treat a task as complex when any of these apply:
- multi-step or multi-file design/implementation
- ambiguous requirements or several reasonable approaches
- unfamiliar, risky, or security-sensitive code
- debugging a hard failure after your first fix attempt
- architecture, API, or data-model decisions
- payload / stream / bridge / server / iOS chain design

Skip Fable for simple, obvious one-liners (typos, renames, trivial edits).

### How to call Fable (Grok Build)

1. Discover the tool schema (do **not** guess parameter names):
   - `search_tool` with query like `vibeask ask fable` (or `ask_fable`).
2. Call the qualified tool via `use_tool`:
   - **tool_name:** `vibeask__ask_fable`
   - **tool_input:** object below.

If the built-in `advisor` tool is available in this environment, you may use that
instead — same purpose. Prefer `vibeask__ask_fable` when you need an explicit
mid-run critique with packaged context.

### Parameters (`vibeask__ask_fable`)

| field | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `question` | **yes** | Exact decision or review you need (one concrete ask) |
| `context` | no | Goal, constraints, findings, errors, assumptions |
| `diff` | no | Proposed patch / git diff to critique |
| `constraints` | no | Array of hard rules Fable must respect |
| `files` | no | Array of `{ path, content, note? }` snippets |

### Example

```json
{
  "question": "Should we lazy-load ChatGifPanelView or defer setupUI only?",
  "context": "Main-thread stall ~3s on chat open. Stack points at ChatGifPanelView.init during setInputBarEnabled. GIF panel is unused on open.",
  "constraints": [
    "Minimal iOS change",
    "Keep GIF panel working on first tap"
  ],
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "ios/ChatModule/ChatInputBar.swift",
      "note": "Eager gifPanel property",
      "content": "private let gifPanel = ChatGifPanelView()"
    }
  ]
}
```

### How Fable’s response gets back to you

```
you (executor agent)
  → MCP tools/call  ask_fable { question, context?, files?, diff? }
       → vibe-ask-mcp.js builds ONE text prompt (budgeted / truncated)
       → spawns: claude -p <prompt> --model fable --tools "" --output-format json
       → Fable model answers as plain text (no tools)
  ← MCP tool result: { content: [{ type: "text", text: "<advice>" }] }
you read the text and implement
```

- Response shape is **plain text** (not a structured JSON decision object).
- Typical sections: **Assessment / Risks / Next steps / Verification**.
- Fable does **not** call tools, edit files, or run shell — advice only.
- You remain responsible for implementation, tests/build, and verification.
- If Fable is unavailable (rate limit / MCP error / 429 / timeout), **note that**
  and continue with your best judgment — do not block the whole task forever.

### Optimize usage (keep Fable calls cheap)

Fable billing scales with **prompt size + reply size**. Default package budget is
~**24k chars** (`VIBE_FABLE_MCP_CONTEXT_CHARS`, was 120k).

**Do:**
- One **sharp** `question` (decision, not a dump of the whole task).
- Short `context` (5–15 lines: goal, error, what you already tried).
- 1–3 file snippets with **only the relevant lines**, not whole files.
- Small `diff` of the proposed change when reviewing a patch.
- **One call** at the decision point; don’t re-ask with the same payload.

**Don’t:**
- Paste full chat logs, entire modules, or multi-MB diffs.
- Attach 10+ files “just in case.”
- Call Fable on every tiny edit or after every failed shell command.
- Re-send the same huge context when a follow-up is only a yes/no.

**Env knobs (bridge / MCP child):**

| env | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VIBE_FABLE_MCP` | on (`0` disables) | Expose `ask_fable` |
| `VIBE_FABLE_MODEL` | `fable` | Advisor model |
| `VIBE_FABLE_MCP_CONTEXT_CHARS` | `24000` | Max packaged prompt chars |
| `VIBE_FABLE_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `240000` | Kill hung advisor spawn |

### Claude Code / bridge note

Claude in this repo may see the same tool as `mcp__vibeask__ask_fable` (or the
built-in `advisor` tool). Same contract: concrete `question` + lean `context`.

## Prefer commands that run without approval

Read-only / search / inspect commands (and pipelines of them) auto-run; commands
that mutate the filesystem or run arbitrary code stop for approval. Prefer the
auto-allowed forms and don't reach for a mutating command unless the task needs the
side effect — e.g. **don't `cp` a file just to read or diff it** (use Read / `cat` /
`diff`), and edit files with the **Edit/Write** tools (auto-allowed) instead of
`sed -i` / redirects. Full list of what runs free vs. asks:
[docs/agent-command-guide.md](docs/agent-command-guide.md).
