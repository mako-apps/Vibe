defmodule Vibe.Accounts.TokenCache do
  @moduledoc """
  Short-TTL cache for `bearer token -> %User{}` resolution.

  Every authenticated REST call runs through `VibeWeb.Plugs.ApiAuth`, which
  resolved the bearer token with a `Repo.get_by(User, login_token: ...)` on
  *every single request*. The app server and Postgres are ~350ms apart, so that
  lookup alone was the floor under every endpoint: a trivial call like
  `GET /api/agent-bridge/status` measured a flat ~690ms in production — one
  round trip to authenticate, one to do the actual work. Endpoints that issue
  more queries came out as near-exact multiples of that same ~350ms unit.

  Authentication is the one query that repeats identically on every request of a
  session, so it is the one worth caching. A hit serves the user struct from ETS
  and the request never touches the database to authenticate.

  Correctness rules:

    * TTL is deliberately short (`@ttl_ms`), so any state we fail to invalidate
      explicitly still self-heals within a minute.
    * `Vibe.Accounts.update_user/2` and `delete_user/1` invalidate the user's
      entries, so a profile write is visible to the next request rather than up
      to a TTL later.
    * Token rotation (logout / re-issue) invalidates by user id, which drops the
      old token's entry as well — a rotated-away token cannot outlive its
      rotation.
    * Only successful lookups are cached. Unknown tokens always hit the DB, so a
      flood of junk tokens cannot fill this table.

  The table is created by `Vibe.Application.start/2` (public, owned by the
  application master) alongside the other process-independent ETS caches.
